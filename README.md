# Projects
 
## Overview
This is repository is used to organize ongoing and completed projects, as well as: 

1. Document skill development in Python (via Juypter Notebooks) and R (via R Markdowns)
2. Increase comfort with version control systems

I will update the repository regularly, with notebooks added and edited as projects evolve. I will do my best to identify and link to the original sources for all materials.

## Repository Layout
This repository is set up in the following way:

***Works in progress***
- `us_national_parks/` contains a notebook that accesses data on visitation at US national parks

***Completed***
- [Specparam tutorial](https://github.com/fooof-tools/DevelopmentalDemo): The goal of this project was to publish a resource for developmental cognitive neuroscientists interested in using this [spectral parameterization](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/) tool. Accompanying manuscript can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2022.101073).

# Random Projects
 
## Overview
This is a personal repository used for organizing ongoing projects that cover diverse topics. More practically, the purpose of this repository is to: 

1. Develop skills in Python (via Juypter Notebooks) and R (via R Markdown)
2. Increase comfort with version control systems

This repository will be updated regularly, with notebooks added and edited as projects develop. I will do my best to identify and link to the original sources for all materials and datasets.

## Repository Layout
This repository is set up in the following way:

- `us_national_parks/` contains a notebook that scraps data on visitation at US national parks

I also want to link to this [specparam tutorial](https://github.com/fooof-tools/DevelopmentalDemo) I worked on with Tom Dononghue, Berenice Anaya, Kelley Gunther, Sarah Karalunas, Brad Voytek, and Koraly PÃ©rez-Edgar. Broadly, the goal of this project was to publish a practical resource for developmental cognitive neuroscientists interested in using this [spectral parameterization](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/) tool. Accompanying manuscript can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2022.101073). 

## Requirements
This repository use Python >= 3.6. Other required libraries (so far) include:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

# Random Projects
 
## Overview
This is a personal repository used for organizing ongoing projects that cover diverse topics. More practically, the purpose of this repository is to: 

- (**1**) develop skills in Python (via Juypter Notebooks) and R (via R Markdown)
- (**2**) increase comfort with version control systems

This repository will be updated regularly, with notebooks added and edited as projects develop. I will do my best to identify and link to the original sources for all materials and datasets.

## Repository Layout
This repository is set up in the following way:

- `us_national_parks/` contains a notebook that scraps data on visitation at US national parks
- *to be continued*

## Requirements
This repository use Python >= 3.6. Other required libraries (so far) include:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- *to be continued*

# Ongoing projects
 
## Overview
This is a personal repository to catalog ongoing projects that are not directly linked to my program of research (click [here](brendanostlund.com) for more information on that work). My goal is to learn new techniques to wrangle, visualize, and analyze data in Python (via Jupyter Notebooks) and R (via R Markdowns). I'll practice these skills using publicly available data on topics of interest, namely, nature, health, and human development. 

I will update the repository regularly, with notebooks added and edited as projects evolve. I'll do my best to link to original sources for all materials.

## Repository Layout
This repository is set up in the following way:

- `us_national_parks/` contains a notebook that visualizes data on visitation at US national parks
- `maternal_care_deserts/` - planned project based data from the [March of Dimes](https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/data?reg=99&top=23&slev=4&sreg=11).

## Requirements
This repository use Python >= 3.6. Required libraries (so far) include:
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

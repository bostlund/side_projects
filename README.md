# Side projects
 
## Overview
This is a personal repository to catalog ongoing and completed projects that are not directly linked to my program of research (see my [academic website](brendanostlund.com) for information on those projects). My goal is to, whenever possible, utilize publicly available data to explore topics of interest. Along the way, I hope to improve my programming skills in Python (via Jupyter Notebooks) and R (via R Markdowns), while increasing familiarity with version control systems. 

I will update the repository regularly, with notebooks added and edited as projects evolve. I will do my best to identify and link to the original sources for all materials.

## Repository Layout
This repository is set up in the following way:

- `us_national_parks/` contains a notebook that accesses data on visitation at US national parks
- `maternal_care_deserts/` - planned project based data from the [March of Dimes](https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/data?reg=99&top=23&slev=4&sreg=11).

## Requirements
This repository use Python >= 3.6. Other required libraries (so far) include:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

# Ongoing projects
 
## Overview
This is a personal repository to catalog ongoing projects, most of which are not directly related to my program of research. My goal is to learn new techniques to wrangle, visualize, and analyze data in Python (via Jupyter Notebooks) and R (via R Markdowns). I'll practice these skills using publicly available data (when possible) on topics of interest, namely, nature, health, and human development. Notebooks will generally be structured based on this [project scoping guide](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/our-work/tools-guides/data-science-project-scoping-guide/) from Carnegie Mellon.

I will update the repository regularly, with notebooks added and edited as ideas evolve. I'll do my best to link to the original source for all materials. 

## Repository Layout
This repository is set up in the following way:

- `us_national_parks/` contains a notebook that visualizes data on visitation at US national parks
- `maternal_care_deserts/` - planned project based data from the [March of Dimes](https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/data?reg=99&top=23&slev=4&sreg=11)
- `zwift_training` - planned project based on personal ride data from [Zwift](https://us.zwift.com/)

## Requirements
This repository use Python >= 3.6. Required libraries (so far) include:
- `os`
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup`
- `pandas`
- `geopandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

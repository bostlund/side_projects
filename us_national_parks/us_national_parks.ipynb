    "This notebook is structured based on a [project scoping guide](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/our-work/tools-guides/data-science-project-scoping-guide/) provided by Carnegie Mellon University.<br><br>\n",
    "**GOAL:** Characterize reactional use of public lands in the United States.<br>\n",
    "**DATA:** Publically avaialable data on recreational use of the US national parks will be scrapped from the [National Parks Service (NPS)](https://irma.nps.gov/STATS/) website.<br>\n",
    "**ANALYSIS:** Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.<br>\n",
    "**ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:** There are no apparent issues with privacy, transparency,\n",
    "discrimination/equity, or accountability in terms of avaiable data. Whether access to the national parks is equitable across communities in the US should be considered further. The NPS has begun administering a [survey](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/socialscience/socioeconomic-monitoring-visitor-surveys.htm) to understand who accesses the parks, and whether access differs as a function of demographic and economic factors. I'd like to incorporate data from that survey into this notebook when it becomes publically available.<br>\n",
    "**ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:** None."

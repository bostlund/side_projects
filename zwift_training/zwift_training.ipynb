    "Biking is the only hobby I've carried throughout my life. I remember proudly riding in my town's annual parade in elementary school. As a college freshman, I salvaged a '70s Univega (\"Maria\"), building her up from the frame. We completed our first century ride in 2015. That bike was stolen while I was in grad school, plucked off the porch at a BBQ. It was replaced by my current bike, a [2017 Fuji Touring Bike](https://www.cyclingabout.com/2017-fuji-touring-bike/) (\"björn\"). I've had many memorable adventures with this bike, and more than a few odd one (e.g., 3am rides to the lab after a placenta collection). björn has never failed me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of my riding over the past few years has been indoors, largely due to the COVID pandemic and rehabilitation following a shoulder surgery. I joined [Zwift](https://us.zwift.com/) last year on the recommendation of a friend. I'm currently using Zwift to train for an extended bikepack trip next summer. Our rough plan is to start in Astoria, OR and continue [~1400 miles along the Pacific Coast](https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/interactive-network-map/) to San Diego, CA. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of Zwift's best features is their ability to create beautiful and intuitive figures from user data, acquired from a bluetooth enabled bike trainer. Due to thoughtful data access options, I learned today that I can dive into my ride data as well.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** *(1)* Characterize bike training patterns over time, starting from March 1, 2022; and *(2)* describe anticipated level of functioning on May 1, 2023.<br>\n",
    "**DATA:** Ride data downloaded from personal Zwift account.<br>\n",
    "**ANALYSIS:** Exploratory data analysis; Bayesian modeling.<br>\n",
    "**ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:** There are no apparent issues with transparency, accountability, or equity in terms of avaiable data. To avoid any unforseen privacy issues, I will not be posting the raw ride data on Github. I will do my best to characterize the data in this Notebook to justify any insights drawn from the analyses.<br>\n",
    "**ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:** None.<br>"

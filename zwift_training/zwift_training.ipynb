    "Biking is the only childhood hobby I've continued to enjoy throughout my life. I remember riding in the local Fourth of July parade in elementary school. As a college freshman, I salvaged a '70s Univega (\"Maria\"), building it up from the frame and customizing it for the next few years. I rode that bike everywhere. It was stolen while I was in grad school; plucked off the porch at a BBQ. Since then, I've had a [2017 Fuji Touring Bike](https://www.cyclingabout.com/2017-fuji-touring-bike/) (\"björn\"). björn has never failed me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of my riding over the past few years has been indoors due to COVID and a shoulder injury. I joined [Zwift](https://us.zwift.com/) last year on the recommendation of a friend. Zwift gamifies bike training by offering an array of virtual routes that vary in difficulty. I'm currently using the app to train for a bikepack trip [~1400 miles along the Pacific Coast](https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/pacific-coast/) next summer. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of Zwift's best features is their ability to create insightful visualizations from user data, acquired from a bluetooth-enabled bike trainer. I recently learned that users can download their ride data, providing an opportunity to further characterize my training experience.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** *(1)* Characterize bike training patterns over time, starting from March 1, 2022; and *(2)* describe anticipated level of functioning on May 1, 2023.<br>\n",
    "**DATA:** Ride data downloaded from personal Zwift (v5.62) account.<br>\n",
    "**ANALYSIS:** Exploratory data analysis; Bayesian modeling.<br>\n",
    "**ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:** There are no apparent issues with transparency, accountability, or equity in terms of avaiable data. To avoid any unforseen privacy issues, I will not be posting the raw ride data on Github. I will do my best to characterize the data in this Notebook to justify any insights drawn from the analyses.<br>\n",
    "**ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:** None.<br>"

Summary data from the training session is located in the `lap` and `session` frames, which contain many of the same variables.
